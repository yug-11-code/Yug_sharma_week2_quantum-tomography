# AI Usage

AI assistance was used for:
- generating starter repository structure (src/docs/outputs layout)
- drafting code templates for dataset generation, model, training, evaluation
- debugging Colab module execution issues
- drafting documentation templates

Verification performed:
- checked dataset shapes and sample values
- verified training convergence (loss decreases)
- evaluated on held-out test set and validated fidelity/trace distance/latency
- confirmed physicality: rho is always PSD and trace-1 due to LL† parameterization
